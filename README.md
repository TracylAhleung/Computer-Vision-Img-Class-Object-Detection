**E-Bees: Machine Learning Computer Vision using a vortex gun delivery system**

Hello,

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning computer vision algorithm that would replicate bee pollination.
This was developed due to the declining bee pollination and thus, an alternative artifical pollination method was developed.
The project was divided into 3 major steps:
1) An image classification technique using keras sequencing
2) An Object detection using Mask-RCNN
3) Depth, Orientation and flower coordinates using a disparity map.

The project was first based on sunflowers, with potential scope to expand it to a larger variety of flowers.
